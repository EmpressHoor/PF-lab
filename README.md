# This game is my Programming Fundamentals final project.(C++)
Welcome to the Snake & Ladder Game project implemented in C++! 
This readme provides a comprehensive guide to understand the project, its tools, and the game's functionality.


# How to Run

Make sure you have downnloaded complete folder with all files in it.
Place it in a folder and open it using any tool that supports C++ like visual studio and Dev C++.
Now you are ready to go. Just run source file and following screen will be displayed:

# Tools used Technology
* C++
* Visual Studio

# Prerequisites 
Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your systems (e.g: visual studio).
Open the project in VS code.

# Instructions
Interact with the console-based interface following the on-screen instructions
Roll the dice and navigate through the snake and ladder board.

# conclusion
In concluding our snake and ladder game in C++, I have merged this classic appeal of board game with the efficiency of modern programming. Through C++ and visual studio, an accessible and efficient console-based experience is crafted.
It has elevated simplicity without sacrificing complexity.
This project not only entertains but also serves as a practical example for those exploring C++ and game development.
